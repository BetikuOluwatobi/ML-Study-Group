### You're to upload your week 6 project in this folder. 
We'd be doing the driven data project as before.


## Can you predict which water pumps are faulty?

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.


## Steps:

   1. Create an account with [driven-data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivendata/data/7/public/702ddfc5-68cd-4d1d-a0de-f5f566f76d91.csv) <br/>
  2. Join the competition [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/) <br/>
  3. Access the data [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/data/) <br/>
  4. Download the datasets and you're set to write your code and build your classification model. <br/>
  5. Make your submission to your file. <br/>
  6. After doing this. Upload a folder with format firstname_week6 putting your notebook and file inside it. <br/>
  7. Create a README.md file which includes the following: <br/>
  
                    a. The model used in making prediction <br/>
                    b. The number of features used and list them.
                    c. Your rank on the driven-data site in the format: <br/>
                    
                                       RANK : 2000<br/>
                                       Total on leaderboard: 11000<br/>
                                       
  8. Deadline for submission is  Saturday 4 April, 2020 11: 59 pm. Please submit before the deadline.<br/>
 
 ### Happy Coding
