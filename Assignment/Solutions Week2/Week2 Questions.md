## Week 2 project.
##### You have three datasets in the ufcdata.zip file you're to work on just two of the dataset, leave the <bold>data.csv</bold> file untouched. 
## These datasets contain missing values, wrong formats among others. You are to clean the dataset. In each dataset, you're to:

### 1. Print the first and last 5 rows of the dataset.
### 2. Print the columns of the dataset.
### 3. Print the shape of the dataset.
### 4. Get the 4th row and and save it in a variable called index_4
### 5. Estimate the summary statistics of the data and check if there's outlier.
### 5. Drop or fill missing values with the suitable value, you're to decide on which one to do based on your own intuition.
### 6. Check for correlation of the columns.
### 7. Save the new DataFrame in a new csv file called processed_data_week2.ipynb


##### You are to put your notebooks and datasets in a folder saved as firstname_lastname_week2 name of notebook should be datasetname_lastname_week2.ipynb

#### PS: data cleaning is the process of identifying and removing (or correcting) inaccurate records from a dataset, table, or database and refers to recognising unfinished, unreliable, inaccurate or non-relevant parts of the data and then restoring, remodelling, or removing the dirty or crude data. A clean dataset is one that has gone through this process. Making your dataset cleaner is an added advantage.
