# ML-Study-Group
Machine Learning Study Group

## Week 1

[Python for data science](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/python-for-data-science)<br/>
[Statistics tutorial](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/statistics-101)<br/>

End of Week Project:

    Write different functions that will calculate the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, percentiles of a list containing many different numbers

    Use the random module to create a rock paper scissors game.

## Week 2

[Data Analysis with Python using Pandas and Numpy](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-analysis-python)<br/>

End of Week Project:

A dataset from kaggle will be used and we’ll be doing some analysis on the data and also to wrangle the data.

## Week 3

[Data Visualization with Python using Seaborne and Matplotlib](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-visualization-with-python)<br/>

End of Week Project:

A dataset from kaggle will be used and we’ll be doing some visualization on the data.

## Week 4

We’ll be working on a dataset as a project which will cover all we’ve done so far  

Project detail:  We'll be doing a competition on [driven data site](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/25/). <br/>

## Week 5 - 8:
  ### We'll be building models all through.
  ### We'll learn supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
