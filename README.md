## Week 1

[Python for data science](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/python-for-data-science)<br/>
[Statistics tutorial](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/statistics-101)<br/>

End of Week Project:

1) Write different functions that will calculate the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, percentiles of a list containing many different numbers

2)Use the random module to create a rock paper scissors game.

## Week 2

[Data Analysis with Python using Pandas and Numpy](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-analysis-python)<br/>

End of Week Project:

A dataset from kaggle will be used and we’ll be doing some analysis on the data and also to wrangle the data.

## Week 3

[Data Visualization with Python using Seaborne and Matplotlib](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-visualization-with-python)<br/>

End of Week Project:

A dataset from kaggle will be used and we’ll be doing some visualization on the data.

## Week 4

We’ll be working on a dataset as a project which will cover all we’ve done so far  

Project detail:  A more complex dataset will be used where we will be analyzing and visualizing the data then try to make sense out of the raw data given.
